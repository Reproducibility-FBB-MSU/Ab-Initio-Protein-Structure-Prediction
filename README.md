# Ab-Initio-Protein-Structure-Prediction
To generate structures consistent with both the local and nonlocal interactions responsible for protein stability via implementations of 3, 5 and 9 residue fragments of known structures into local sequences similar to the target sequence using a Monte Carlo simulated annealing procedure with further refinement of the obtained complete tertiary structure according to the article: "Ab initio protein structure prediction of CASP III targets using ROSETTA" written by Kim T. Simons, Rich Bonneau, Ingo Ruczinski, David Baker.
